I spent most of today figuring out how to implement themes and dynamic links in Jekyll after actually figuring out how to implement my own custom pages last night. Links gave me a significant amount of trouble as their functionality seems to change between the development and live environment, at least in regards to prepending to the domain to the internal file path.

In the intern group, we did some brainstorming on our project and came up with several ideas. Currently, we have narrowed it down to:

1. An app which helps groups decide on things through the use of a voting tournament
2. An app which helps groups split checks
3. An app which helps an individual schedule their day by breaking up and scheduling tasks for them.

We still need to decide on exactly which one we will do, and I will need to decide on a framework for us to use and get familiar with soon.

End of day

We have decided to cut the individualy scheduling app and are leaning towards the group tournament decision app, building as a webpage in ruby on rails. I had a pairing with Noah O. in Durham, and we have concluded that we will have to fight to the death for the title of official HQ Noah and ownership of the desk.
