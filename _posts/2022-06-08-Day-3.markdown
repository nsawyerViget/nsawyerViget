The blog is pretty much done, so I will stop developing it here and instead focus on the group project. Posts will continue to be uploaded throughout the days, but the features for this are complete.

We spent most of today in various meetings, mostly discussing the project. We've currently agreed to move forward with the tournament app. That means I will need to figure out how to do live updates with rails in the next few weeks.

Note to self - ask Danny about websockets or something I can hook up to rails to do live voting that will update without needing to do a refresh.
