This day has been a wild ride. I have spent most of it on rails research and in meetings. I will probably be spending most of the day tomorrow doing the same thing. I looked into integrating react into rails with little success so far, but some progress. I have also looked into doing websockets and other semi-real time elements. I discussed with Dylan and he suggested Action Cable for rails, and I am also looking into Rails Turbo.
