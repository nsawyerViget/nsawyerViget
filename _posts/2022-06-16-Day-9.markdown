Today I made some huge headway on the intern project. I had a meeting with Annie in a pairing tour and we discussed the structure of the database for the intern project, and she showed me how instead of using a count, I could use a new table as an event log for votes. This will allow much easier integration of one vote per use per round in the future when I add users.

I also got most of the programs installed for the loaner mac to run rails, as well as redis and postgresql. I set up the repo for the actual project we will be working on from here on out, so now we can truly begin working.
