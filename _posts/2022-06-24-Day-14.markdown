Today I mostly spend setting up the start of the API for the frontend based on the data models I have added so far. I'm leaving early today so I'm not getting as much done as I want, but I'm getting there. I've spent some time really thinking about stuff I have left to do for an mtp and included it below.

Stuff left to do:

### Week 4:
Monday: Set up initial votes for choices in a bracket.
Tuesday: Set up building rounds from initial votes.
 - Allow initial voting on choices
 - Create a round
 - Sort by initial votes
 - Cut off the bottom ones down to a power of two
 - Build matchups from the new ordered set
 - Add button to build first round and stop allowing new choices
Wednesday: Set up building rounds form winners of previous rounds
 - Get winners from previous round and check that there is more than 1
 - Build new round
 - Build new matchups
 - Add button to advance build new rounds
Thursday: Set up heroku
Friday: Add new API endpoints for the new functionality to create init_votes, stop initial voting, and build and advance to the next round

### Week 5:
Monday: Set up game states and add API endpoints to change states
Tuesday: Set up exiting and blocking new users once a game has started
Wednesday: Set up admins and restrict round and game state management actions to only the admin user of a bracket
