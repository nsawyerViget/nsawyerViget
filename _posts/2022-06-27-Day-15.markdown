I got lots of work done today on the backend, and I'm close to wrapping up the data models. All I have left on that end is game state and admins. The rest from here on out should be visual stuff, integrating with react, turbo, and websockets.

From my previous schedule:

### Week 4:
[DONE]Monday: Set up initial votes for choices in a bracket.

[DONE]Tuesday: Set up building rounds from initial votes.

 - Allow initial voting on choices
 - Create a round
 - Sort by initial votes
 - Cut off the bottom ones down to a power of two
 - Build matchups from the new ordered set
 - Add button to build first round and stop allowing new choices

[DONE]Wednesday: Set up building rounds from winners of previous rounds

 - Get winners from previous round and check that there is more than 1
 - Build new round
 - Build new matchups
 - Add button to build and advance to new rounds

Tuesday: Set up heroku

Wednesday: Add new API endpoints for the new functionality to create init_votes, stop initial voting, and build and advance to the next round, start working on admin and admin permission only actions, add admin user as a field in bracket model

Thursday: Build join screens and format them, start working on turbo streams to get names to appear live

Friday: Set up game states and add API endpoints to change states, make sure some actions can only be done from certain states and chage the state accordingly.

### Week 5:

Monday: Set up exiting and blocking new users once a game has started, and handle cases for ending game when there is only one matchup in the round and the next round is built.
