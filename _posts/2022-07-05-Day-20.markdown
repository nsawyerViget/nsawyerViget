Today was lots of bugfixes and differentaiting joining and creating a room. Rooms now have generated codes instead of names, and all codes are unique. There was a lot of bugs in the game state checks and admin checks, but some of those have been fixed and some have been written down to fix later.

From my previous schedule:


### Week 5:

Monday: Holiday

[DONE] Tuesday: Differentiate create and join pages. Autogenerate new brackets with unique names.

[EOD TUESDAY]

Wednesday: Set up exiting and blocking new users once a game has started, and handle cases for ending game when there is only one matchup in the round and the next round is built.
