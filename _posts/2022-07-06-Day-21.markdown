Lots more bugfixes today. The day started with an impropmtu pairing time with Danny because somehow I managed to run rails db:drop on heroku when you're not supposed to be able to because I was trying to empty the database and migrate it from the start again. Turns out adding the database url, which was a heroku recommended fix, was the source of many of the issues we were facing, and removing it allowed me to just run db:migrate. In the future, run heroku db:reset. Since then, I've worked on several small things. Lots of new api endpoints. The state has now been encapsulated in an enum in bracket.rb and should not be referenced by magic numbers anymore. I didn't get to users readying up like I intended to because of the bugfixing heroku, but I should be able to do that tomorrow alongside providing Andrew with whatever api endpoints he needs.

From my previous schedule:


### Week 5:

Monday: Holiday

[DONE] Tuesday: Differentiate create and join pages. Autogenerate new brackets with unique names.

[EOD TUESDAY]

Wednesday: Heroku bugfixing. Turn state into an enum instead of magic numbers. API endpoints.

[EOD WEDNESDAY]

Thursday: Allow users to become ready when they are done voting for a round. Probably just store this as an int on the bracket, or use another join table between users and brackets.
