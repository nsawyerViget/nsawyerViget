The most exciting day of the project so far! We're all done with the MVP! Advancing rounds is complete, functioning, and implemented. Games can now be played from beginning to end in their entirety. As long as there are no complications with leaving and everyone readies up when they are supposed to, games are in a playable state! We did a full test with the entire intern team and Haroon at the end of the day and all seemed to go smoothly.
