A bit of excitement today. We took the advisors through a tour of the app and played multiple games, one on mobile and one on desktop, both of which went well. There were some minor critiques of button placement and wording, which we're planning to correct. After that, we got the override button done.

Since my work on Joust is finishing up, I am moving into my personal project now, which is going to be a Turbo chat app. I've mapped out the basics of the database and will be sending that out for review from Annie and Danny. This should be pretty easy due to my previous experience with Turbo, so I'm going to be taking this project as an opportunity to learn proper development practices instead of pushing myself coding-wise.
