Got some comments from Danny and did a full review with Annie today on the personal project. Nothing major really needed to change except some naming to prevent conflicts. The only major addition was to add a friend_requests table to track friend requests being sent out before they were accepted (create a friendship) or rejected (delete the request). 

Today I started actual implementation, doing it right this time. I've added the whole suite of test frameworks: rspec, capybara, factory_bot, shoulda_matchers, simplecov, and database_cleaner, which should all allow me to write tests and maintain 100% test coverage. I've added rooms, users through devise, and room_memberships, and they all seem to be working as intended. They also all have full test coverage, still up to 100% as of me writing this, though I've noticed that simplecov doesn't seem to track coverage for some important things like controllers, which seemed very odd to me.
