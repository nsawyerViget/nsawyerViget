Thankfully it was a pretty calm day today in the office. We got some minor discussion done for the project. The major hurdle we overcame today was the stress test. With all of us connected with as many tabs as we could, we couldn't even manage to push it over 5 connections, so I assume we'll be good for any number of connections at the labshare. For the rest of the day, I'll be investigating a minor bug that Jason found where the return button wasn't working.

As for Caterwaul, my chat app, Danny set me up with the github workflow to automatically run tests and forbid a merge if any tests fail, or if test coverage drops below 100%. I got that working after some minor bugs with it merging a second argument into the first argument of the cp command due to some strange use of curly braces and a comma. That has now been merged and all brances will be required to pass tests and have 100% coverage to merge into main.
