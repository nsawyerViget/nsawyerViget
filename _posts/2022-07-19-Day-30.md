Today I got rooms and users set up for Caterwaul. Rooms just hold a name, and users are standard Devise users. Everything using devise had to be fixed because all devise links break when turbo is running, but that is as simple as adding `data: {turbo: false}` to every link. Rooms are linked to users with a through table, `room_memberships`. This is the structure that will eventually hold things like role assignments when I add the role system.
