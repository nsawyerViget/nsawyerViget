Today was real rough. We had the presentation dry run at the end of the day and we scheduled it far too late. We had lots of tech issues, the message wasn't clear, and we ran way over time. Thankfully, we had a meeting at the end of the day that let us fix most of that. We've changed to a recorded demo instead of a live one, so I'll be working on a script for that one and memorizing the end slides of the presentation for most of tomorrow.
