Today was spent on fixing stuff and getting ready for now the two presentations coming up. For the Joust presentation, I scripted out and memorized the lines for the video demo tomorrow. We're doing much better after we made the changes we discussed yesterday, and everyone is feeling much more confident.

In addition to that, I have been informed that me and Thomas will be taking over the dev meeting on August 2nd, where we will have 55 minutes to ourselves to talk about joust and then anything we want to talk about. I've decided that I'm going to be talking about Evolutionary Algorithms, so I put together a quick slide deck on that. Hopefully I can manage to make it undertandable for everybody in a short amount of time.
