Joust is done! We got through our presentation with flying colors! We also did some demos with the staff and didn't have any stress issues on the system.

I didn't get anything done on Caterwaul because I'm waiting on feedback on the big PR to merge it and it's blocking any progress. I'm currently spending my time working on the presentation for August 2nd on evolutionary algorithms. I got several slides done with some images in and then coded the algorithm to prove its simplicity. I did one in both ruby and lisp, and I think I remembered it pretty well.
