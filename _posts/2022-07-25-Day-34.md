Two major additions today: room invitations and the standardrb linter. Room invitations exist as a through table between rooms and users, just like memberships. Accepting one creates a membership, deny one does nothing, and either choice deletes the invitation. Room invitations have a special validation on their model, which had to have its own class to implement it. It checks whether or not a user is already a member and prevents the creation of an invitation if the user is already a member. This also required including additional files at the startup of the rails app.

The standardrb linter, and the editorconfig were additions suggested to handle my ever-present formatting issues due to SublimeText's formatting defaults. After fighting them for so long, I eventually gave in and accepted David's advice to add standardrb as the simplest one. After some growing pains of preventing if from modifying configs, it seems to be working fine enough and preventing any problems. Editorconfig, added at the suggestion of sol, didn't change much, but it did introduce me to SublimeText plugins, and the one thing is really does is ensure I have newlines at the end of files whenever I save the file.
