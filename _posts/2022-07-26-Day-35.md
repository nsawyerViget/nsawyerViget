Today was mostly spent on some permissions work. I added some extra checks as before_actions to lots of common actions like sending messages and accessing the app page. This should prevent some unexpected scenarios like sending messages while not signed in and such things. It also prevents users from taking actions that should be reserved for others. Users, for instance, should not be able to accept invites sent to other users, or send messages as other users.
