Pretty quiet day today. I spent this morning working with Danny on a paired ticket on Catalist. It was mostly just adding the ability to order certain items on certain screens using the Django admin panel. From there I mostly sat back and tried to provide support on getting Wagtail up an running, an alternative to the Django admin panel. It was a bit difficult, but it's much more visually pleasant.

This afternoon I worked on fixing some scrolling for Caterwaul. There was an interesting bug on not recognizing my RoomInvitationValidator, but that was resolved by just closing and reloading rails, since the program doesn't seem to recognize updates for loading files. There was another interesting bug with turbo not updating a form and instead duplicating it, which seems to have been caused by an extra closing block for a list being written every time the turbo frame was duplicated, causing early termination of some blocks and frames, leading to the form not being updated and instead a new one was created and placed on top of the old one. Normally that would have caused a syntax error in any other langauge to warn me what was happening, but HTML is sometimes a bit too forgiving.
