A day of slow and unsteady progress, no thanks to Turbo. I've spent most of today working on the ability for users to create invitations for other users. First, there was a bunch of issues with the form because it is not directly associated with the create action of a controller. Eventually I fixed that by putting in a url instead of a model at the start of the form. Next, there was an issue with turbo replacing the base url of loaded forms and buttons with "example.org" for no reason. I'm struggling to get it to overwrite that, even when setting rails configs to determine the base url, which it seems to be ignoring.

On the other hand, I managed to get the invitations to actually appear, even if they couldn't be accepted. When they are accepted, they also appear in the list of rooms as well! Progress is progress.
