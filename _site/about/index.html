          <p>The blog is pretty much done, so I will stop developing it here and instead focus on the group project. Posts will continue to be uploaded throughout the days, but the features for this are complete.</p>

          <p>I spent most of today figuring out how to implement themes and dynamic links in Jekyll after actually figuring out how to implement my own custom pages last night. Links gave me a significant amount of trouble as their functionality seems to change between the development and live environment, at least in regards to prepending to the domain to the internal file path.</p>

          <p>This will mark the completeion of my first day. I finished the onboarding, met a lot of the team, and I even made this cool blog!</p>

          <p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
